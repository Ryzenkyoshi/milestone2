          <p class="w3-justify" style="font-size:120% "> In our time today, social media is something that will not disappear from people because 
            there is so much you can do with it, such as communicating with others no matter where they 
            are, gathering information, and expressing your opinion about it. So wherever you look, you will 
            really see people using it. But we know that it has both good and bad effects on us, especially on 
            our mental health. Because of the many things it can do, we no longer notice the time we spend 
            on it. That's why it's alarming what it can do to us. That's why we need to understand its potential 
            effects on our mental health and what we can do to balance its use. <br>

            
          </p>
          <p class="w3-justify" style="font-size:120% "> Social media has many benefits for mental health. It allows people to connect and 
            maintain relationships, especially those separated by distance or seeking like-minded 
            communities. Platforms provide opportunities for self-expression, enabling users to showcase 
            their creativity and talents. Moreover, social media is a valuable resource for mental health 
            education, offering access to support groups, therapy options, and coping strategies.Despite 
            these benefits, social media has several major drawbacks. First, the unhealthy tendency of users 
            to compare themselves with others. Idealized and curated versions of other people's lives lead to 
            feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. Excessive use, promotes dependency, disrupts sleep 
            patterns, and reduces real-world interactions. Cyberbullying and online harassment are 
            also prevalent issues, which result in heightened stress, anxiety, and depression for victims.There 
            is an established relationship between the use of social media and mental health 
            conditions. Long-term usage has been linked to a higher risk of anxiety, depression, and 
            stress. Because social media is designed to be addictive, as they are programmed to reward 
            engagement, this exacerbates these issues by increasing the amount of time spent using the 
            service. Moreover, the existence of harmful content, such as trolling or misinformation, 
            can exacerbate pre-existing mental health conditions or prevent people from seeking appropriate 
            treatment.Healthy social media habits are required to overcome these challenges. It includes 
            setting boundaries, such as limiting screen time and avoiding its use before bed, to improve sleep 
            and reduce dependency. Following inspiring accounts and staying away from toxic 
            interactions helps to curate a healthy online environment. Digital detoxes and making time for 
            off-line activities such as exercise or hobbies can also help maintain 
            a balance. Being mindful while using social media enables people to use it positively and be 
            aware of its influence on their feelings.. <br>

            
          </p>
          <p class="w3-justify" style="font-size:120% "> In summary, social media has a significant impact on mental health, both negative and 
            positive. Although it causes higher anxiety and depression due to comparisons and addictive 
            tendencies, it also provides support and community to those in need. With the development of 
            social media, therefore, it requires responsible use so that the better benefits it offers outweigh 
            the negative effects of its use. Therefore, understanding the side effects of social media is crucial 
            for maintaining individuals' mental well-being in this highly interconnected world. <br>
